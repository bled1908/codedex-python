# # Classes
# As technologists, we create programs to solve problems that stem from everyday life. In the real world, the objects around us are complex.

# Suppose we want to build a database of students in a school, where each student will have different attributes, like name, year, GPA, and enrolled status.

# Using our previous knowledge, we could represent each student as a list:

# # Lists with student id, name, year, gpa, and enrolled status

# student_1 = [1001, 'Asiqur', 10, 3.7, True]
# student_2 = [1002, 'Jerry', 9, 3.8, True]
# student_3 = [1003, 'Rose', 12, 3.6, False]

# However, we have no way of knowing which item corresponds to which attribute – it will get messy fast. For example, does student_2[1] refer to the name, year, or GPA?

# This is where classes come in!

# With classes, we can create our own data type and use them to model everyday objects with their own unique characteristics and behaviors.

# Classes serve as a template for the objects created using that class. Simply put, a class is like a blueprint. A class can make a bunch of objects with identical sets of attributes, similar to how a car manufacturer can use a model blueprint to build hundreds of cars in different colors, interiors, wheels, etc.

# In our example, 📜 (class) ➡️ 👩🏼‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 (objects).

# Here's the basic syntax for creating a class in Python:

# class Name:
#   # Attributes inside

# The class keyword following a class name creates the class. By convention, the class name is capitalized.

# For example, to make a Student class, we can write:

# class Student:
#   name = ''
#   year = 0
#   gpa = 0.0
#   enrolled = False

# The Student class has four attributes:

# .name of the type str (text string)
# .year of the type int (integer number)
# .gpa of the type float (decimal number)
# .enrolled of the type bool (boolean value)
# With this class, we can represent each class attribute as a variable, and we will learn how to access or change them in later sections! For now, let's implement a class.
